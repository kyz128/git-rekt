@CBCAdrianH @uOttawa Not sure if it’s common or not for a journalist to fangirl over someone then bash them behind their back, where was this question/issue when you were 2ft away from me doing the interview? Most of my proceeds go to my employees, I put my ppl on not tear them down unlike yourself
My guy! So dope!
Basketball is my first priority but life outside of basketball gets busy. @richarddeitsch covers one of the things keeping me busy off the court in his latest piece. Check it out:

Disappointed that we never got a chance to meet, though I could feel his energy &amp; see how big his heart was from afar. He was a big part of the culture &amp; spreading positivity. It’s on us to honor him the right way &amp; keep his name alive forever. RIP Nip 🏁 ኤርምያስ ኣስገዶም
From Barcelona, Spain to our studio in Toronto, @MarcGasol aka “The Big Orca” joins the set to talk about being traded to the Raptors, his passion for sailing and gardening, and more. By the way, somebody please tell @HarrisonSanford normal people pour the cereal in the bowl 1st.
