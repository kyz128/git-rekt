Then to the game. At the end of the day yes we all wanted more fireworks, points, etc etc but as a competitor and former football player those games happen like that and I couldn’t not like it! Defense wins championships. The best team prevailed and Brady is still The 🐐!
Recap of Super Bowl Sunday. The commercials were pretty good(NFL 100 spot and @MillionDollar spot tops the chart). 😉🤷🏾‍♂️The halftime show looked dope from watching on TV. Wish TS had more time and you forget how many hits Maroon 5 got in their archives 👏🏾.....
Brady the 🐐!! 💍💍💍💍💍💍.
Man where Shams, Woj, Haynes, McMenamin at????.... 🤷🏾‍♂️
That’s was AMAZING!!! Got me so hyped I wanted to be in it too! Kudos 👏🏾

And we now know that black boys need black men in their lives.  Doesn't even need to their father.  Thank you to every strong, admirable black man who I had as a kid. Please listen and share with your friends and family.  We must continue to educate ourselves on the real issues.
Everyone should take time to listen to this. Really deep look at what young black men go through. The idea that it's just about "class" isn't true. It's about so much more.

Unbelievable time at Akron Coach D!! Best of luck to u at Duquesne. I know your dad is proud to see u where he laid the path
Sit down, BE HUMBLE @kendricklamar
Great workout, Great lunch, now time for Great nap! Trifecta!
Can't stand for it anymore because of I ❤️ and will die right now for my Sport and for SPORTS in general. #JustMyOpinion
are out there please stop worrying about u and if u really care for the kid give them the guidance as my Coaches, mentors did for me!.....
We need to be pushed, kicked, loved, then pushed and kicked again cause that's what brings and breads the hunger inside of us! Whoever u....
on how much they can benefit in the long run from the kid not realizing they're cheating the shit out of the kid. We as kids don't know.....
won't get on them because their afraid of losing the kid, or losing the sponsorship that comes with the kids, or have their own agenda......
Reason I'm saying this is I believe this is a major part of the reason why kids don't succeed as much because the leaders, coaches, etc.....
they showed toughness and stayed on me every single day! Never sugar coded nothing, told me to real and lit me up when I wasn't applying....
Man if it wasn't for Big Frank, Bruce Kelker, Willie Earl, @CoachDambrot @CoachDruJoyce I wouldn't be the player/man I am today! As a kid...
Humbled, but this goes to the parents raising, teachers educating &amp; partners supporting my kids. You're THE leaders. #StriveForGreatness🚀
Congrats @CoachDruJoyce and the Boys on bringing that Chip back to where it belongs!! #StateChamps🥇#IrishPride☘️
