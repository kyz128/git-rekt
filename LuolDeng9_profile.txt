Basketball should be about the kids not the coaches. Help the kids get better. And by the kids getting better so is ur team.
I feel like coaches need to focus on kids more, work on their skills and not worry so much about the team. That's how we Did it at Brixton.
Question for my British fans. Is Basketball getting better or worse in the UK? And what should be done about that?
Loosing to miami hurt man. I'm trying to do things to get it out my mind but I can't. Already wana be back in the gym.
